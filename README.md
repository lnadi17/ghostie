# Ghostie

Ghostie is an infinite platformer game developed using the Unity Engine. 
Player controls a ghost-like character named Ghostie, who automatically moves forward infinitely and jumps on the platforms to progress.

The project was developed as part of the GeoLab Juniors program, where I learned the basics of graphic design and game development. 
The artwork for Ghostie was drawn by my friend, Tata Bezhuashvili.

## Gameplay
The objective of Ghostie is to progress through the game by jumping on platforms and shooting down enemies. The game is infinite and the player's goal is to achieve the highest possible score. 
The player has three lives, if they fall off a platform or collide with an enemy, they lose a life. The game ends only when the player loses all three lives. 
The game also includes Pacman-looking enemies on some of the platforms, which can be shot down by the player.


## Instructions
To play Ghostie, you will need to download `build.apk` file which is in the project root. Alternatively, you can play it from the engine if you have the Unity Engine installed on your computer. 
The controls for Ghostie are simple, you must touch the left side of the screen to jump, and the right side to shoot.
